        This Matura Work is a combination of a project and the correlating
        documentation thereof. As seen in the title the project consists of a
        fitness app which will be programmed from scratch. The resulting app and
        code is open-sourced and available on Github. The documentation includes
        the process from designing to programming, debugging and testing. It,
        combined with further parts of the Matura Work are all on this website.
        Disclaimer: Everything on this website is still subject to change untill
        the final Deadline.
      </p>
      <p>The main question I will aim to answer is:</p>
      <p>How does the process of programming a fitness app look like?</p>
